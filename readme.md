In [this video]( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCSIXLIzhzk), Cody uses a football field to give a sense of scale to the universe.  I thought I would take this idea and run with it, and expand upon it by turning it into a website wherein you can interact with and scale a simplified view of the earth, served using a combination of HTML Canvas, a bit of javascript, and Google Maps.  

# Overview

Start at a view of the globe.

Have user select region.

Overlay the sun at one and and the earth at the other.
    
Allow independent scaling of earth and universe.
